# Notes:
# - `folder` should match a folder path under `public/images/items/` that contains
#   the photos for that item (e.g. `public/images/items/table01/` with multiple
#   image files). The seed script will collect images from that folder and
#   set the first image as `imageUrl` and include all images in `images`.
# - Fill this file (add/remove rows) and run `node scripts/seed-from-csv.mjs` to
#   regenerate `src/data/items.ts` used by the site.
